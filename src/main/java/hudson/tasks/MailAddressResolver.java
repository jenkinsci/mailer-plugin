/**
 * Infers e-mail addresses for the user when none is specified.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is an extension point of Jenkins. Plugins that contribute a new implementation
 * of this class should put {@link Extension} on your implementation class, like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Extension
 * class MyMailAddressResolver extends {@link MailAddressResolver} {
 *   ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Techniques</h2>
 * <p>
 * User identity in Jenkins is global, and not specific to a particular job. As a result, mail address resolution
 * only receives {@link User}, which by itself doesn't really have that much information in it.
 *
 * <p>
 * So the common technique for a mail address resolution is to define your own {@link UserProperty} types and
 * add it to {@link User} objects where more context is available. For example, an {@link SCM} implementation
 * can have a lot more information about a particular user during a check out, so that would be a good place
 * to capture information as {@link UserProperty}, which then later used by a {@link MailAddressResolver}.
 *
 * <h2>Performance considerations</h2>
 * <p>
 * Mail address resolution is a potentially time consuming process. It can considerably slow down operations
 * relaying on mail address resolution, especially on Jenkins instances having registered several resolvers.
 * Searching through all projects is generally a bad idea. See <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-16437">JENKINS-16437</a>
 * for more details.
